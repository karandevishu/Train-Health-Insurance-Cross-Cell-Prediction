# Train-Health-Insurance-Cross-Cell-Prediction
Train Health Insurance Cross Cell Prediction is a Machine Learning classification problem statement to analyze train health insurance.
Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue. In Exploratory Data Analysis, we categorized the Age as YoungAge, MiddleAge, OldAge.Then we categorized Region_Code and Policy_Sales_Channel to extract some valuable information from these features. We explored the independent features using some plots. Then the feature selection we used ExtraTreesClassifier and then the train test split. For Model prediction, we used supervised machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, Random forest classifierand XGB Classifier. Then comparing all the models and seeing which model gives the best results.
